# This is the documentation for the netrics deployment project.


## About

Netrics is a wrapper around [FATE](https://github.com/chicago-cdac/fate).
Fate is a command scheduler, and netrics uses fate to schedule network related
measurements.


To run experiments, netrics will be deployed in RP4, that will be located at 
customers houses. This will provide us with the ability to observe the network
in real time.


A description of the type of measurements supported can be found in this [link](docs/measurements.md)
